    <h2>TRAFFIC SIGNAL VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEM</h2>
    <P>
        <strong>About Project</strong><br>
        
            <li>This study aims to provide an better system which can be able to release the traffic depending on the count of vehicles.</li><br>
            <li>This study demonstrates the capability of DL models to overcome the traffic congestion by simply allowing the vehicles through
                a signal depending on the length of vehicls.
            </li><br>
            <li>In this work, we implementation the application to detect the number of vehicles in the images from the user and gives vehicles counts.</li><br>
            <li>To detect the vehicles count here we are using the YOLO pretrained weights.</li>

        <strong>ALGORITHMS</strong><br><br>
        <strong>YOLO :</strong><br>
        <p>
            Yolo is a part of object detection, Object detection is a computer technology related to
computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of
a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Well-researched
domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection. Object detection has
applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.
Every object class has its own special features that helps in classifying the class for example all
circles are round. Object class detection uses these special features. For example, when looking for
circles, objects that are at a particular distance from a point (i.e., the center) are sought. Similarly,
when looking for squares, objects that are perpendicular at corners and have equal side lengths are
needed. A similar approach is used for face identification where eyes, nose, and lips can be found and
features like skin color and distance between eyes can be found.
APPLICATIONS: It is widely used in computer vision tasks such as image annotation,
activity recognition, face detection, face recognition, video object co-segmentation.
